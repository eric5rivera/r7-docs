# Buying My Motorola R7: A Ham’s Journey into DMR

As a ham radio newbie dipping my toes into Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), I started with the Anytone 878 and 578. Solid radios, but I kept hearing whispers that Motorola was the gold standard for commercial-grade DMR—think the Rolls-Royce of radios (minus the butler). I wanted my first Motorola to be modern, reliable, and well-supported, so I set my sights on the R7, their current flagship model. Here’s how I got my hands on it and started this adventure!

## Which Model Did I Choose?
I went with the **Motorola R7, UHF, Enabled, with Display** (model number: **AAH06RDN9RA1AN**). Why this one?  
- **UHF**: Perfect for my local repeaters and urban environments where UHF shines.  
- **Enabled**: Comes with premium features like AES256 encryption and Bluetooth, which I might not use *yet* but sound cool to have.  
- **Display**: A crisp color screen makes programming and menu navigation way easier for a beginner like me.  

This model felt like the sweet spot for a ham new to Motorola’s ecosystem—modern, feature-packed, and ready for my DMR experiments.

## Buying from a Local Brick-and-Mortar Shop
I picked up my first R7 from **Day Wireless Systems** in Milwaukee, Oregon. Why go local?  
- **Support**: As a DMR rookie, I wanted a shop where I could ask questions (and maybe beg for help if I mess up a codeplug).  
- **Relationship**: Building a rapport with pros who know Motorola gear inside-out felt like a smart move.  
- **Gear**: Along with the radio, I grabbed a **PMKN4265 Motorola OEM Programming/Data Cable**. Trust me, you’ll need this to program the R7 via Motorola’s Customer Programming Software (CPS). Pro tip: double-check compatibility with your computer, as some cables can be finicky with modern USB ports.  

Day Wireless was awesome—friendly staff, quick service, and they didn’t laugh when I admitted I was still figuring out DMR basics. If you’re near a good radio shop, I highly recommend stopping by. It’s like having a ham radio mentor you can visit in person!

## Scoring a Second R7 on eBay
One radio wasn’t enough (ham radio is addictive, okay?). I snagged a second R7, used, from a fellow ham on eBay. Why used?  
- **Cost**: Saved some cash compared to buying new—great for a beginner on a budget.  
- **Ham Community**: Buying from another ham felt like joining the club, plus they included some preloaded codeplugs that gave me a head start.  
- **Condition**: I made sure the listing had clear photos and a good description to avoid any surprises. Always ask about the radio’s history (e.g., firmware version or past use) when buying used.  

Word of caution: Check that the seller reset the radio properly, or you might inherit someone else’s settings. Also, verify the model number matches what you want (like my UHF, Enabled, Display version).

## Why the R7? My Take as a Beginner
The R7 is a beast—rugged, powerful, and packed with features I’m still learning to use. It’s overkill for some ham tasks, but its crystal-clear audio and solid build make it worth the investment. If you’re a ham thinking about jumping into Motorola DMR, the R7 is a fantastic choice, especially if you want a radio that’ll grow with you as you get more comfortable with DMR.
